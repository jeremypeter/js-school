# The Color View-o-matic

This app takes user input via a text field and display the color when they submit the form. 


## Objective
1. Create the HTML in the `index.html` file
1. Add styles to the `styles.css` file
1. Add JS functionality to the `scripts.js` file

## JS Functionality

### Acceptance Criteria
1. On submit of the color form, the background of the color container should update based on the value of the text field
1. Prevent the default behavior of form submissions when the user submits the form so it doesn't refresh the page
1. Place the focus on the text field when the page initially loads so the user doesn't have to click in the field
